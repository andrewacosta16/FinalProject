# FinalProject
As a data analyst, I have been given the prompt to get a dataset and work on it using machine learning models. The dataset I am working on has data of NBA player stats since 1980. The goal of this project will be to make a prediction on what affects a player to be voted for MVP. The datset proves this column along with statistics per player. I start with exploring the data to fully understand the data I am working on. Once I understand, I start performing operations to clean the dataset to make it able to work on. Then i generate visualizations to visualize different correlations of columns. I then split the target column and scaled and encoded feature columns. After oversampling due to the target column being inbalanced, the data is ready to perform models on. In order for this I fit the data into the model and study my accuracy results. According to my model's results, i will make a business decision determening which model i preferred and which columns most directly correlate to whther or not a player gets votes for being MVP.
